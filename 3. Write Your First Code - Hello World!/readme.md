🚀 **Core JavaScript Concepts** 🚀

1️⃣ **<script> tag**: The <script> tag is used to embed JavaScript code into an HTML document. It can be placed in the <head> or <body> section. Scripts are automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.

2️⃣ **External scripts**: JavaScript code can be placed in separate files and linked to HTML using the "src" attribute in the <script> tag. External scripts are beneficial for caching, reducing traffic, and making pages faster.

3️⃣ **Type and Language attributes**: The "type" attribute in the <script> tag specifies the MIME type of the script. It's not required for modern JavaScript. The "language" attribute is obsolete and no longer makes sense because JavaScript is the default language.

4️⃣ **Comment inside <script> tags**: In the past, comments like "<!-- ... //-->" were used to hide JavaScript code from old browsers. This is not used in modern JavaScript as it's no longer necessary for current browsers.

🚀 **Code Examples** 🚀

**Inline Script:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    alert('Hello, world!');
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>

</html>
```

**External Script:**

HTML code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>

  <script src="alert.js"></script>

</body>

</html>
```

JavaScript code in alert.js:
```javascript
alert("I'm JavaScript!");
```

Now, you have a better understanding of attaching JavaScript code to an HTML page and using external scripts! 🎉
