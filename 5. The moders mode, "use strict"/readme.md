# Understanding "use strict" in JavaScript üöÄ

## Introduction üìú

For a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues, but it also meant that any mistakes or imperfect decisions made by JavaScript's creators remained in the language forever. In 2009, ECMAScript 5 (ES5) introduced new features and modifications to existing ones. To maintain backward compatibility, most changes were off by default and required explicit enabling with the "use strict" directive.

## "use strict" Directive üß©

The "use strict" directive is a string placed at the beginning of a script or a function to enable strict mode. It ensures that the code adheres to the "modern" way, which includes stricter rules and disallows certain unsafe practices.

```js
"use strict";

// Code in strict mode
```

## Enabling Strict Mode üîí

Ensure that "use strict" is at the top of your scripts to enable strict mode for the entire script. Placing it below any code (even comments) would not activate strict mode.

```js
// "use strict" below is ignored--it must be at the top

"use strict";

// strict mode is now activated
```

## No Reversion üîê

Once you enable strict mode, there's no going back to the old behavior. There is no "no use strict" directive to revert to the previous mode.

## Developer Console ‚öôÔ∏è

By default, most developer consoles do not use strict mode. You can try using "use strict" at the top of the input, but it might not work correctly in some older browsers. An alternative approach is to wrap your code in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) with "use strict" inside.

```js
(function() {
  'use strict';

  // Your code here
})();
```

## Should We Use "use strict"? ü§î

In modern JavaScript, using "classes" and "modules" automatically enables strict mode. So, if you are using these advanced language features, you can omit the "use strict" directive.

However, for now, it's recommended to include "use strict" at the top of your scripts to ensure better code quality. Later, when your codebase is fully utilizing classes and modules, you may consider omitting it.

## Conclusion üèÅ

Understanding and using "use strict" in JavaScript is essential for writing cleaner and safer code. It sets the foundation for adopting modern JavaScript features and ensures better compatibility across different environments. Embrace strict mode as a helpful tool to improve your coding practices! üòä


### Here are some questions and quizzes related to the "use strict" directive in JavaScript. Try to answer them, and I'll provide the answers below:

1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the "use strict" directive in JavaScript?

2. **Question:** Where should the "use strict" directive be placed to enable strict mode for the entire script?

3. **Quiz:** Identify which of the following code snippets enable strict mode correctly:

- A)
```js
'use strict';
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

- B)
```js
"use strict";
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

- C)
```js
console.log('Hello, world!');
"use strict";
```

- D)
```js
console.log('Hello, world!');
'use strict';
```

4. **Quiz:** What happens if you try to revert to the old behavior after entering strict mode using "use strict"?

- A) It is possible to revert using "no use strict" directive.
- B) It's not possible to revert to the old behavior once strict mode is enabled.

5. **Question:** How can you enable strict mode when running code in the browser console?

- A) "use strict"; should be placed at the top of the code.
- B) Use Shift+Enter to input multiple lines and put "use strict" at the beginning.
- C) Wrap the code in an IIFE with "use strict" inside.

6. **Quiz:** Which of the following statements is true about strict mode?

- A) Strict mode enables all JavaScript features automatically.
- B) "use strict" can only be used at the top of the script.
- C) Strict mode is enabled by default in developer consoles.

Answers:
1. **Answer:** The "use strict" directive in JavaScript enables strict mode, which enforces a stricter set of rules and disallows certain unsafe practices, resulting in more secure and reliable code.

2. **Answer:** The "use strict" directive should be placed at the top of the script to enable strict mode for the entire script.

3. **Quiz Answer:** Option B correctly enables strict mode with "use strict" placed at the top of the script.

4. **Quiz Answer:** B) It's not possible to revert to the old behavior once strict mode is enabled. Once strict mode is entered, it remains in effect for the entire script or function.

5. **Answer:** B) Use Shift+Enter to input multiple lines and put "use strict" at the beginning to enable strict mode when running code in the browser console.

6. **Quiz Answer:** B) "use strict" can only be used at the top of the script. It must be placed before any other code or comments to be effective.
