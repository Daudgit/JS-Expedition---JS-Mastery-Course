# Understanding "use strict" in JavaScript 🚀

## Introduction 📜

For a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues, but it also meant that any mistakes or imperfect decisions made by JavaScript's creators remained in the language forever. In 2009, ECMAScript 5 (ES5) introduced new features and modifications to existing ones. To maintain backward compatibility, most changes were off by default and required explicit enabling with the "use strict" directive.

## "use strict" Directive 🧩

The "use strict" directive is a string placed at the beginning of a script or a function to enable strict mode. It ensures that the code adheres to the "modern" way, which includes stricter rules and disallows certain unsafe practices.

```js
"use strict";

// Code in strict mode
```

## Enabling Strict Mode 🔒

Ensure that "use strict" is at the top of your scripts to enable strict mode for the entire script. Placing it below any code (even comments) would not activate strict mode.

```js
// "use strict" below is ignored--it must be at the top

"use strict";

// strict mode is now activated
```

## No Reversion 🔐

Once you enable strict mode, there's no going back to the old behavior. There is no "no use strict" directive to revert to the previous mode.

## Developer Console ⚙️

By default, most developer consoles do not use strict mode. You can try using "use strict" at the top of the input, but it might not work correctly in some older browsers. An alternative approach is to wrap your code in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) with "use strict" inside.

```js
(function() {
  'use strict';

  // Your code here
})();
```

## Should We Use "use strict"? 🤔

In modern JavaScript, using "classes" and "modules" automatically enables strict mode. So, if you are using these advanced language features, you can omit the "use strict" directive.

However, for now, it's recommended to include "use strict" at the top of your scripts to ensure better code quality. Later, when your codebase is fully utilizing classes and modules, you may consider omitting it.

## Conclusion 🏁

Understanding and using "use strict" in JavaScript is essential for writing cleaner and safer code. It sets the foundation for adopting modern JavaScript features and ensures better compatibility across different environments. Embrace strict mode as a helpful tool to improve your coding practices! 😊
