# Understanding Variables in JavaScript 🎯

## Introduction 📜

In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They act as "named storages" for information, making it easier to work with and manage data in a JavaScript application.

## Creating Variables with "let" 📝

To create a variable in JavaScript, you use the "let" keyword. Here's an example of declaring and assigning a variable:

```js
let message;
message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message
```

You can also combine variable declaration and assignment into a single line:

```js
let message = 'Hello'; // define the variable and assign the value
```

## Variable Naming 🏷️

Variable names in JavaScript should be meaningful and descriptive. They should contain only letters, digits, underscores, or the dollar sign. The first character of a variable name cannot be a digit. Here are some examples of valid and invalid variable names:

Valid variable names:
```js
let userName;
let test123;
let $ = 1;
let _ = 2;
let myVeryLongName;
```

Invalid variable names:
```js
let 1a; // cannot start with a digit
let my-name; // hyphens are not allowed in the name
```

It's a good practice to use camelCase for variable names when they contain multiple words. For example:
```js
let myAge = 25;
let firstName = 'John';
```

## Using Constants with "const" 🛡️

To declare a constant (unchanging) variable in JavaScript, use the "const" keyword. Constants cannot be reassigned after they are declared. For example:

```js
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
```

## Reusing Variables 🔁

Avoid reusing variables for different purposes. Creating new variables with descriptive names is essential for code readability and maintainability. Reusing variables can lead to confusion and debugging issues.

## Naming Conventions 📚

Follow good naming conventions for variables:

1. Use human-readable names like "userName" or "shoppingCart."
2. Avoid abbreviations or short names like "a," "b," or "c," unless it's clear from the context.
3. Make variable names maximally descriptive and concise.
4. Use uppercase constants for "hard-coded" values.

## Tasks 📝

1. **Task:** Declare two variables "admin" and "name." Assign the value "John" to "name." Copy the value from "name" to "admin" and show the value of "admin" using "alert."

2. **Task:** Create a variable to store the name of our planet and another variable for the name of a current visitor to a website.

3. **Task:** Examine the given code that includes a constant "birthday" and a constant "age" calculated from "birthday." Decide whether it's right to use uppercase for "birthday," "age," or both.
