# User Interaction: Alert, Prompt, Confirm

In this demo, we'll explore three browser-specific functions to interact with users: `alert`, `prompt`, and `confirm`. These functions allow us to display messages, ask for user input, and get user confirmation.

## Alert

The `alert` function displays a message in a modal window and waits for the user to press "OK". It's a simple way to convey information to the user.

Example:
```javascript
alert("Hello");
```

## Prompt

The `prompt` function shows a modal window with a text message and an input field for the user. It can accept a default value and returns the text from the input field or `null` if canceled.

Example:
```javascript
let age = prompt('How old are you?', 100);
alert(`You are ${age} years old!`);
```

## Confirm

The `confirm` function displays a modal window with a question and two buttons: OK and Cancel. It returns `true` if OK is pressed and `false` otherwise.

Example:
```javascript
let isBoss = confirm("Are you the boss?");
alert(isBoss); // true if OK is pressed
```

## Tasks

### A Simple Page

Create a web page that asks for a name and outputs it.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

  <script>
    'use strict';

    let name = prompt("What is your name?", "");
    alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  </script>

</body>
</html>
```

## Important Questions

1. What is the purpose of the `alert` function?
2. How does the `prompt` function work? What values does it return?
3. Explain the behavior of the `confirm` function.
4. What are the limitations of using modal windows for user interaction?
5. Why is providing a default value important in the `prompt` function for Internet Explorer?

## Code Examples

Here are some additional code examples for practice:

1. Using `alert` to display a message:
```javascript
alert("Welcome to our website! ðŸŽ‰");
```

2. Using `prompt` to ask for user input:
```javascript
let favoriteColor = prompt("What's your favorite color?", "Blue");
alert(`Your favorite color is ${favoriteColor}!`);
```

3. Using `confirm` to get user confirmation:
```javascript
let proceed = confirm("Do you want to continue?");
if (proceed) {
  alert("Let's move forward!");
} else {
  alert("Maybe next time!");
}
```

Feel free to experiment with these examples to enhance your understanding!

ðŸš€ Happy coding and learning!
